# Project Plan for Creating Behavioral Change in Public Spaces
## Summary
In this document I am going to describe the process of planning the Streetparty project, phases of idea generation, drafting and implementation. 

## Description
Streetparty is not a social network. Is a online bulletin board based on real streets. The Streetparty project aims to increase communication and interactivity between people who live or work closely in public spaces. Users can create announcements or events based on streets. Just like a street bulletin board, everyone can join to the street or post or comment on information. In order to protect the freedom of “Public Space”, there is no any restriction to the sharing of information.

## Target Audience
The Target Audience of the project is the people who are willing to arrange or attend events interactively at public space, and informed about their close environment.

## Personas
### Emma
Emma is 26 years old, newly married woman who moved to the new suburban area. She wants to meet new people and does not how to do.

### Brandon
Brandon is a father who wants to find friends for his 2 year old doughter to play together. He thinks it’s time to play outside with others for her. There are no parks around and he does not want her doughter to be one of those internet children. He also wants to get rid of unused items at their home, arranging a garage sale, but does not know any of their neighboors, even though he is living there for 3 years.

### Carlos
Carlos is a 21 year old street sports fan, he works in the city center and he is wondering if there are someone who wants to play football together at the close park to his workplace.

In short expats, new movers, people who want to be interactive with and aware of their surroundings are targeted. Smart phone owners with internet access is a quick group to count. However the relatives of those people are also able to benefit this project.

## The Purpose
According to romea.cz;
> “There are no platforms in towns or villages, no places where people from “either side” might safely analyze and discuss everything that disrupts their relations as neighbors and where, over time, they could reach agreement together on how to address this disruption. By the word “safe”, I mean an environment without arguing, where there will be an effort by all to listen to each other.“
There are not much opportunities to meet new people and socialize even they are living 10 meters away. 

## Stakeholders
Potential stakeholders for the project are;
1. Local authorities willing to increase communication between local communities
2. Representatives of expats, immigrants and diverse communities that are stigmatized
3. New movers, companies targetting people who are newly moved.
4. NGO’s who are willing to increase awareness at surroindings about a local event or issue

## Competition
There are 2 several competitors in the market. 

### Nextdoor
The first is Nextdoor, a free social network without any advertisements. Strict identity verification. Loosely moderated. $210.2 Million in 4 Rounds from 17 Investors. Has it’s revenues from investors. Privacy and ethical Issues. Racial Profiling (due to community alert).

### Homeelephant

HomeElephant is the second mobile application. Describes itself as: “Home Elephant provides a social media application that connects neighbors and neighborhoods.” Is not an effective competitor, bad and difficult user interface, too many features makes it difficult to understand.

## Swot Analysis
### Strength
#### Meeting new people could mean;
1. People who can cooperate and help
2. New playground friends for children
3. A potential to solve problems related surroinding together.

### Weaknesses
- Due to that the platform is free to use and join, there could be privacy concerns about the neighborhood. However this, would prevent latter issue of “transforming areas into new ghettos.”
- Advertisement, spamming and fraud is possible. However same problems exist also in physical space. For example in an announcement attached to a  street bullet in board with phone number, there is always a chance to encounter fraud, scam or ads. The “streetparty” is more secure than the physical counterpart due to that is hard moderated opposite of Nextdoor.


### Thread
According to concerns about primary competition “Nextdoor” there is danger of emerging close communities gathering around strong beliefs and closedness against other and diverse. However the freedom concept and opennes of the app prevents this thread to happen.

## Marketing Plan
1. Social Media Existence: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+
2. Youtube video or Kickstarter campaign
3. User interviews, testimonials
4. Blog posts
5. Email audience and newsletters, ask for invitation on page
6. Targeted announcement
7. Guerrilla marketing at streets
8. Strong Landing Page

## Landing Page and Website
Landing page is the strongest and weakest part of an apps success. Most important thing for a landing page, before it’s design is copywriting. The catchy landing page is effective on current attention deficit time stingy readers.

A good landing page consists of:
1. A Clear Header
The header should have just minimum elements. Those minimum elements are Logo, About, Privacy Policy and Terms of service.
Some social buttons can be located here.

- http://unbounce.com/landing-pages/7-elements-of-a-winning-landing-page/
2. Hero (The most important part of the page)
- Title of the app
- Headline (Must be catchy to grab attention in a limited time)
- Sub-headline (A longer charming description)
- CTA: Call To Action. Often is a button or a small email input with messages like “Buy now”, “Join” or “Subscribe”. In the terms of mobile apps, here Google or ios Appstore buttons located.

3. Benefits and Features
- Benefits comes first. Why the user have to use the app? Why he or she should join or download? 3 or 4 Benefits for the potential user. Each benefit has it’s own icon, title and small description. Whitespace usage is important to protect the user’s attention and prevent him or her from distraction.
- After benefits, features should be added. What user can do if he or she installs the app? A few phrases and not so long information. (If a user scrolled here, is curious about our application and wants some more information)
4. Testimonials
Previous user experiences, social proof, an avatar, name and age of user, a small text   containing user’s experience. Similar to our targeted personas.

## Usability
Due to having a wide range of users, characteristic elements making difficult to focus are avoided. A flat or swiss design approach is adequate. A young man or a newly mowed mother can use the app with same pace. Universal guidelines for technical phase should be implemented. People with reading disabilities, using hearing aids, elder people or blind people using screen readers should taken into account. The best way is to reach this principle is to respect the coding and design standards for software.

## Platforms

## Project Implementation Phases
Everything starts with data. According to Gov.uk we should concentrate on user needs first. What do they need and what system needs from them to operate. To achieve this our approach to project implementation is going to be Minimum Viable Product method. This is one of the Agile Software Craftsmanship technologies for efficient software development (Engin, Lemi Orhan, 2014) Instead of precisely defining the end product at the beginning, we start with minimal and principal needs. This approach is also good for having feedbacks immediately on the development phase.

### User Roles
- Visitor (Not registered or Logged in)
- User (Registered and Logged in)
- System Administrator

### Content
- User information: email, password, visible name, photo, age, gender
- Street: Street Name (gathered from Google Geocoding API), Locality, Region, Country, Zip Code, Lat and Lng for map
- Announcement: Title, Content, Created datetime, User ID, optional image, Announcement type ID 
- Announcement Type: Title, Color (Defined by System administrator)
- Comment: Text, Created datetime, Announcement ID, Parent comment ID (if replied)
- Recent Places: For each user, User ID, Street ID, Check in date.

### Pages
- “Login or Signup” Page: Where users can login. (I decided to merge with register page, has only email and password, no second password input field and no email confirmation. If user has entered a wrong password, can always ask for a new password using her or his email at any time) Login with Google, Facebook and “Twitter”, using oAuth technology.
- Home, consist of a Search Input for searching a street and Recent Places List. On empty state, system will show “You don’t have any recent place, find a street to party!” Street Title, and small Region, Country, Zip information will appear. On empty state, system will show “Here is silent. Be the first to party!” And Add announcement Button. An announcement card will consist of, Announcement title, creation datetime, content excerpt, visible name of creator and number of coments. If person clicks to see more, announcement page appear.
- Announcement Page: Title, visible name of creator, creation date, full content and all comments will appear. In future lazy loading should be implemented to prevent user to download all of  data once and crash device.
- Edit announcement and edit comment forms are modals appearing on  the same page.
- Profile page, where user can change self information to public. Because of this is not a social network there is not going to be any other features. An optional feature is that user can see his  last entries. However other people can’t see this information if they did not checked in same street. Only the common checked in streets and announcements are visible between two users. User profile editing forms are also modals.
- Side menu: Is accessible from every page for users logged in. Consists of profile, home and logout links.


## Ideas changed
First I thought ot create verified users and not allowing the nicknames. However after reading Nextdoor’s racial profiling and issues regarding privacy I did not include this feature. Everyone can join and create announcements if they searched and reach the street. If they access to the street page they are automatically checked in and this is added to their recent places. I also thought to make verified users limiting recent places to five but this also confilcts with freedom.

## Empty state
For the inital beta phase, members are going to be selected by invitation to prevent spam. Users are going to be invited and asked if they are willing to attend, arrange events or being informed about their surroundings. Marketing team is going to arrange initial “garage sale” events to promote the app.

## Technology
Due to usage of HTML5 as an app, the platform can have a device free life cycle working on desktop and mobile. However a reliable internet connection is a MUST. App store installation and the website access are starting points. Most of the technology used are based on Open Source Software. OSS is ideal for this kind of projects because of good documentation and free  and accessible knowledge base. Also developers at platforms like stackoverflow.com are willing to answer questions.

## Sharing of the knowledge
In order to increase my knowledge and have quick feedback from the community, the software is going to be open source. The project development phase experiences is also going to be shared in a blog with under a dedicated subdomain like development.streetpartyapp.com. A very good example of this is https://gds.blog.gov.uk/ where developemnt experience of UK Government Digital Services is shared. Also all source code is  currently public accessible at https://github.com/mtkocak/streetparty

### Education
Javascript is considered as most common and adequate programming languages for beginner front-end designers without any programming knowledge. I am planning to write step by step tutorials about how I designed and implemented application and share these in workshops in the future.

## Project Phases
Software development and designing is not an easy task. A project, if is not a freelance or private one, has to be well documented.
1. Generation of Ideas
At this phase I kept my mind free and not limited by observing around and listening my concerns about the public space. What did I need, I also talked with the people I know. I created 20 ideas to select one of them.
2. Gathering Inspiration
3. Research
4. Sketching
5. Information Architecture
6. Making of Robust prototypes. 
Prototypes running seamlessly on devices, without permitting user to being aware of running a mockup. All buttons are clickable.
7. Software Development
- Version Control
8. Testing
9. Going live
10. Continuous Feedback
User interviews

### Potential threads at the implementation phase
- Losing motivation
- Lack of feedback
- Too much documentation and planning

## Timing
As an agile principle, a software project is a live object having need of continuous optimization based on user feedbacks. We cannot consider a software project finished as it should be maintained, upgraded, updated continuously.
1. Planning
2. Prototyping
3. Documenting
4. Optimization

## Prototyping Tools
In this project I used codiqa (https://codiqa.com/) as an instant jQuery mobile protoyping tool. Rapid prototyping instead of image mockups or tools like Maven, are much more better to achieve end product and instant feedback.

## Exit Strategy
For this project, being as an open source and solidarity freemium service, there would be not any plan for exit strategy. The risk for failue exists, however the educational side of the project are evident. All source, project phases and planning, research and implemetation techniques are open. And this creates a useful knowledge base for mobile application creation roadmap.

## Tech Notes

The plan for implementation is to using HTML5 pages compiled using Adobe PhoneGap build. Instead of building the data storage on a relational database, firebase.io service is better for rapid prototyping at the initial stage. firebase.io is a backend service, NO-SQL document database free for limited amount of usage. Creating MVP, a working product on a device is much more better instead of creating full scale mockups and non working psd prototypes. This approach is much more efficient in software interface design and gathering user experiences quickly. 

The technology used at front-end is modular. Based on newest jawascript technologies such as Bower, Grunt, NodeJS, jQuery Mobile. Due to that installation and deployment after changes are easier  thanks to step by step tasks. 

## Future plans
- To implement robust testing techniques for UI and code
- Software Requirements Specification Document is not planned. The danger to be avoided is “overplanning” and “overdocumentation” See: https://basecamp.com/books/Getting%20Real.pdf
- Google Analytics and conversions
- A/B testing for interface
- Marketing agreements
